# Video Composition Rules

## Branding
- Never use "Powered by Claude Code" or any `Branding` component in videos.

## Social Media Thumbnails
- Every composition must have a bold, visually engaging first frame (frame 0) that works as a social media thumbnail/preview.
- Use a custom hero overlay (large text, glows, color accents) that is fully visible at frame 0 and fades out as the main content appears.
- The thumbnail should hook viewers to click — no blank or barely-visible opening frames.
